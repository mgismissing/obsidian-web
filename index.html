        <h2>So, what is Obsidian exactly?</h2>
        <p>Obsidian is an isolated group of webpages that are completely different from the World Wide Web.</p>
        <p>For example html doesn't exist and is replaced by Shard for layout and Ruler for styles. The only supported server side language is Frame, but you can also use php and the other traditional ones (but it's recommended you don't because even the file naming is different, see <a href="/files.html">File Naming</a>).</p>

    <section id="how-to-access">
        <h2>How to access Obsidian websites</h2>
        <p>Obsidian is a closed network, so only a selected group of people can see Obsidian websites. And even if you found the websites in a normal browser, how would you read them? Remember, no HTML/CSS in Obsidian. There is only Shard and Ruler.</p>

        <p>You really thought that you could find the "Download" for a software that doesn't exist HERE?</p>
